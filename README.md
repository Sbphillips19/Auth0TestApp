To run the app-

1. git clone https://github.com/Sbphillips19/Auth0TestApp
2. cd Auth0TestApp
3. npm install
4. npm start

Some key things to note-
Since this is a demo app credentials are stored in the Auth.js file, however these would never be exposed to the public and I would use a .env file or some other way to store credentials/ they would never be published to github
